Virgil is a basic 2D game library built using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/index.php) and [Vala](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala); designed for Linux and directly built for [elementary OS](https://elementary.io)...

### What is Virgil?

---

The Vala Game Library (VGL), or formally known as 'Virgil' is my answer to 'if I can't find it, I'll make it'. I grew tired of installing Windows VM's to use common 2D game engines and having to run around in circles finding a Linux compatible engine I can use to fruitlessly make simple games, a basic demo can be found at [the following repo](https://github.com/lxmcf/virgil-demo).

Virgil is built from the ground up using Vala and the SDL2 library, this is my first major project as well as my first dip into 'proper development' using a new language.

### Runtime Dependencies

---

- `libsdl2-2.0-0`
- `libsdl2-ttf-2.0-0`

### Build Dependencies

---

- `valac`
- `glib-2.0`
- `libsdl2-dev`
- `libsdl2-ttf-dev`
- `meson`

> _**Note:** Virgil can run on Mac OS with the use of `brew` but is not 100% supported at this stage._

### Compiling

---

Virgil can be built in many ways, as a subprject, a static library or a shared library. It is recommended to use Virgil as a static library if you are not using [Flatpak](https://www.flatpak.org/). Please see the example ways of building the library and installing system wide:

```bash
# Static library
meson build --prefix=/usr --default-library=static
ninja install -C build

# Shared library
meson build --prefix=/usr --default-library=shared
ninja install -C build
```

> _**Note:** Virgil is not affiliated with the [elementary OS](https://elementary.io) project, I just love what they are doing!_

### FAQ

---

**Q: Why is Windows not supported? Do you hate Windows?**

A: I don't hate Windows at all, it is a great OS for what it does, however Virgil was birthed from me switching to Linux a few years ago and not having access to my then preferred game engine ([GMS2](https://www.yoyogames.com/)) and the tools I found were not what I wanted, so Linux/UNIX is my target.

**Q: Will Virgil ever officially support Windows?**

A: Nope, Virgil will always be __officially__ exclusive to Linux and UNIX systems, however if you wish to create a Windows compatible fork of Virgil, I encourage you to do it!

**Q: Will Virgil ever cost money?**

A: Never, Virgil will remain a FOSS piece of software and I will NEVER charge for use of Virgil, however if enough interest is gathered, I may consider donations but have no plans at this stage!

**Q: What do you mean by 'experimental' support for an OS?**

A: It means I might be working on adding it to the core library however there is no guarantee it will ever be considered 'stable' or make it to a full release.

**Q: Do you know what you are doing with this?**

A: No ðŸ™‚

**Q: How many times are you going to rewrite Virgil?**

A: Yes ðŸ™‚

**Q: When will version X come out?**

A: Yes ðŸ™‚
